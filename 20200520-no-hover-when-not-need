# No hover, when not needed

I’ve been using the hover for a long time just to get things triggered on mobile. This is great! A mobile menu for instance can do very nice things with opening and closing just using the hover, no other logic is required and works perfect on iOS devices.
But sometimes, the hover is just a visual thing. In that case, iOS makes you click twice on the same link in order to actually use it. This can be really annoying! But I’ve found a solution, which apparently was there all the time already but I just didn’t know about it.

```css
@media (hover: hover) {
  a:hover {
    background: yellow;
   }
}
```

Just using a media query, put your hovers in there and they will only be used on devices which do use the hover in a “normal” matter.
